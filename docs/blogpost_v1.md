# DOOMHouse: 3D game rendering engine in pure ClickHouse SQL
### How my X-mas vacation got DOOMed trying to push coding agents to the limit.

## TLDR;
First result and final result.


## Motivation
Pushing frontier models to the limit by creating complex, non-trivial code that demonstrates concept
understanding in novel settings. 


## Limimtations
Only implement 3D rendering engine (no monsters this time).


## Initial approach
First prompt.


## Iterative optimization
Show a table with iterative optimizations
(Requires back-tracking changes and making diffs and summaries of diffs)


## Visual debugging
Show example screenshots that were succesfully debugged.


## Concepts

### Collision detection 
"Slide-and-Collide" Physics Engine

### Vectorized Ray-tracing
Uisng Array Functions like arrayMap, arraySort, groupArray, arrayMin

### Texture mapping

### Shading
RGB channel split.

### Lightning 
Distance Fog and North/South light difference
Show image without texture that shows the lighning effect.

### Post processing
anti-aliasing


## Optimizations

### Array maps

### Lookup tables
